# Global rules

Prefer built-in tools: read over cat, edit over sed/awk,
grep over rg, glob over find, write over echo/tee, list over ls.
In bash: fd over find, rg over grep, trash over rm.
Subagents for specialized work. Parallel independent calls.

Short responses, no emojis, no decorations. Reference code as file:line.
Preserve existing style and comments unless incorrect.
In comments, avoid dashes and trailing dots.

# Global Rules

## External File Loading

CRITICAL: When you encounter a file reference (e.g., @rules/general.md), use your Read tool to load it on a need-to-know basis. They're relevant to the SPECIFIC task at hand.

Instructions:

- Do NOT preemptively load all references - use lazy loading based on actual need
- When loaded, treat content as mandatory instructions that override defaults
- Follow references recursively when needed

## General Guidelines

Always prefer built-in tools and MCP servers if available.

## Development Guidelines

To find up-to-date documentation, prefer the Context7 MCP server or dedicated tools
like Flux Operator MCP @search_flux_docs instead of web search.

For Flux Operator MCP: @docs/flux-operator-mcp.md

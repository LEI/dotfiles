Fields differ between output modes for the same resource type. Goal: every output mode emits the same canonical fields in the same order, with clear names. Only cosmetic rendering differs (full path vs short UUID, full datetime vs relative, borders vs none). Design: define a canonical schema per resource type derived from resource_defs or a new 'schema_for' helper. Apply shape_for_sub (or a simplified version) before both display and structured output. The envelope for -o json changes from {apiVersion, kind, project, count, items} to {kind, project, count, items} (drop apiVersion — too Kubernetes-specific; keep kind, project, count for context). Sessions canonical fields: [slug, uuid, size, modified] (uuid = full 36-char, not truncated — truncation is display-only). Memory: [name, path, size, modified]. Plans: [name, sessions, project, size, modified]. Teams: [name, members, size, modified]. 'wide' mode: same fields, full values (full uuid, full path, full datetime). 'table'/'default': truncated uuid (8 chars), relative modified, ~ paths. json/yaml: full values (same as wide, but structured). This requires: (a) split shape_for_sub into shape_canonical (field selection/naming, applied always) + shape_display (value truncation, applied for table/default only); (b) render json/yaml branch uses shape_canonical rows; (c) render default/table/wide branches use shape_display rows.

# Test

## BATS

- [Bash Automated Testing System](https://bats-core.readthedocs.io)

The `setup` function will be called before each individual test in the file.
Each file can only define one setup function for all tests in the file.
However, the setup functions can differ between different files.

The `teardown` function runs after each individual test in a file,
regardless of test success or failure.
